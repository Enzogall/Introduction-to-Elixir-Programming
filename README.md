# Introduction to Elixir Programming

Welcome to this accessible introduction to **Elixir programming**! In the following sections, we have curated a collection of exercises specifically tailored to help you understand and master the fundamental concepts of Elixir, a dynamic, functional language designed for building scalable and maintainable applications.

## Compilation and Execution

We will be using [Elixir Playground](https://playground.functional-rewire.com/) to run Elixir code. This platform allow you to experiment without installing anything locally.

## Exercise 1: Print Even Numbers from 1 to 50

Write a function that prints even numbers between 1 and 50.

## Exercise 2: Multiply Two Numbers

Create a function that takes two integers and returns their product.

## Exercise 3: Convert String to Uppercase

Write a function that converts a given string to uppercase.

## Exercise 4: Count Characters in a Sentence

Count the number of characters in a sentence, excluding spaces.

## Exercise 5: Find the Maximum in a List

Write a function that finds the maximum number in a list of integers.

## Exercise 6: Factorial of a Number

Implement a function that returns the factorial of a number.

## Final Task: Simple Calculator CLI

Create a module that acts as a basic command-line calculator with the following capabilities:

* **Addition**
* **Subtraction**
* **Multiplication**
* **Division**

The module should read input as `{operation, a, b}` where `operation` is a string ("add", "subtract") and perform the corresponding calculation.
